Installing Python-Markdown
==========================

Checking Dependencies
---------------------

Python-Markdown requires the ElementTree module to be installed. In Python2.5+ 
ElementTree is included as part of the standard library. For earlier versions 
of Python, open a Python shell and type the following:

    >>> import cElementTree
    >>> import ElementTree

If at least one of those does not generate any errors, then you have a working
copy of ElementTree installed on your system. As cElementTree is faster, you
may want install that if you don't already have it and it's available for your
system.

------------

The simplest way to install Python-Markdown is by using SetupTools. As and
Admin/Root user on your system do:

    easy_install ElementTree
    easy_install Markdown

That's it, your done.

If you preffer to manually install Python-Markdown in Windows, download the
Zip file, unzip it, and on the command line in the directory you unzipped to:

    python setup.py install
