Python-Markdown 2.4 Release Notes
=================================

We are pleased to release Python-Markdown 2.4 which adds one new extension
and fixes various bugs. See the list of changes below for details.

Python-Markdown supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.

Backwards-incompatible Changes
------------------------------

* The "force_linenos" config setting of the CodeHilite extension has been
marked as **Deprecated**. It had previously been marked as "Pending Deprecation"
in version 2.3 when a new setting "linenums" was added to replace it. See 
documentation for the [CodeHilite Extension] for an explanation of the new 
"linenums" setting. The new setting will honor the old "force_linenos" if it 
is set, but "force_linenos" will raise a DeprecationWarning and will likely 
be removed in a future version of Python-Markdown.

What's New in Python-Markdown 2.4
---------------------------------

* Thanks to the hard work of [Dmitry Shachnev] the [Smarty Extension] has been 
added, which implements [SmartyPants] using Python-Markdown's Extension API. 
This offers a few benefits over a third party sript. The HTML does not need
to be "tokenized" twice, no hacks are required to combine SmartyPants and
code highlighting, and we get markdown's escaping feature for free. Please try 
it out and report bugs and/or improvements.
