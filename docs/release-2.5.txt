Python-Markdown 2.5 Release Notes
=================================

We are pleased to release Python-Markdown 2.5 which adds a few new features
and fixes various bugs. See the list of changes below for details.

Python-Markdown supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.

Backwards-incompatible Changes

What's New in Python-Markdown 2.5
---------------------------------

* The Extension Configuration code has been refactord to make it a little easier 
for extension authors to work with config settings. As a result, the 
[extension_configs] keyword now accepts a dictionary rather than requiring 
a list of tuples. A list of tuples is still supported so no one needs to change 
their existing code. This should simplify the learning curve for new users.

* The [Smarty Extension] has had a number of additional configuration settings
added, which allows one to define their own sustitutions to better support
languages other than English. Thanks to [Martin Altmayer] for implementing this feature.

will not directly effect end users, the code is being better tested whuch will 
benefit everyone.

* Various bug fixes have been made.  See the
[commit log](https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/commits/master)
