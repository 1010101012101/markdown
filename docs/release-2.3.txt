Python-Markdown 2.3 Release Notes
=================================

We are pleased to release Python-Markdown 2.3 which ...

Python-Markdown supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.3, and 3.3.

Backwards-incompatible Changes
------------------------------

* Support has been dropped for Python 2.5. No guarantees are made that the
library will work in any version of Python lower than 2.6.

* "safe_mode" has been further restricted. Markdown formated links must be
of a known whitelisted scheme when in "safe_mode" or the url is discarded.
The whitelesited schemes are: 'http', 'https', 'ftp', 'ftps', 'mailto',
'news'. Schemeless urls are also permitted, but are checked in other ways - 
as they have been for some time.

What's New in Python-Markdown 2.3
---------------------------------

Various bug fixes have been made.  See the
[commit log](https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/commits/master)
for a complete history of the changes.
