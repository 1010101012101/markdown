Python-Markdown 2.3 Release Notes
=================================

We are pleased to release Python-Markdown 2.3 which ...

Python-Markdown supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.3, and 3.3.

Backwards-incompatible Changes
------------------------------

* Support has been dropped for Python 2.5. No guarantees are made that the
library will work in any version of Python lower than 2.6.

* "safe_mode" has been further restricted. Markdown formated links must be
of a known whitelisted scheme when in "safe_mode" or the url is discarded.
The whitelesited schemes are: 'http', 'https', 'ftp', 'ftps', 'mailto',
'news'. Schemeless urls are also permitted, but are checked in other ways - 
as they have been for some time.

* The ids assigned to footnotes now contain a dash (`-`) rather than a colon
(`:`) when `output_format` it set to "html5" or "xhtml5". If you are making
reference to those ids in your JavaScript or CSS and using the HTML5 output,
you will need to update your code accordingly. No changes are necessary if
you are outputing XHTML (the default) or HTML4.

* The "force_linenos" config setting of the CodeHilite extension has been
marked as Pending Deprecation and a new setting "linenums" has been added to
replace it. See documentation for the [CodeHilite Extension] for an explaination
of the new "linenums" setting. The new setting will honor the old "force_linenos"
if it is set, but it will raise a PendingDeprecationWarning and will likely be
removed in a future version of Python-Markdown.

* The "RSS" extension has been removed and no longer ships with Python-Markdown.
If you would like to continue using the extension (not recomended), it is archived
on [Github](https://gist.github.com/waylan/4773365).

What's New in Python-Markdown 2.3
---------------------------------

Added the [Adminition Extension] which implements [rST-style][rST] admonitions 
to the Markdown syntax. However, be warned that this extension is experimental
and the syntax and behavior is still subject to change. Please try it out and
report bugs/improvements.

[rST]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#specific-admonitions

Various bug fixes have been made.  See the
[commit log](https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/commits/master)
for a complete history of the changes.
